	abstract={The energy band structure of metallic gold has been calculated by non-relativistic and relativistic augmented plane wave methods. The E ( k ) against k curves are plotted for some directions of high symmetry. The conduction band is an s-d mixture. The density of states curves are plotted. The results are compared with available experimental and other theoretical data on the band structure of gold}
